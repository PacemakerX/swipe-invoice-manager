# Invoice Data Management App

A web application that automates the extraction, processing, and management of invoice data from various file formats, including Excel, PDF, and images. The app organizes extracted data into three main sections: Invoices, Products, and Customers. It uses React for the frontend, Redux for state management, and integrates AI-powered data extraction for all file types.## Badges
